# TMPro Invert Color Shader
Unity Shader for inverting TMPro text color based on what's behind it

Special thanks to [@QuiteDan](https://twitter.com/QuiteDan) for providing the original invert shader in a [Unity Forum post from 2013!](https://forum.unity.com/threads/invert-colors-shader.205244/)

## Setup
1. In Unity, go to Package Manager and make sure you have TMPro installed
2. Then go to Import Package -> Custom Package and select ```TMProInvert.unitypackage``` from this repo
3. That's it! Now in your TMPro text, scroll down until you see "FONTNAME Material" and where it says "Shader", select TextMeshPro -> Distance Field Invert
